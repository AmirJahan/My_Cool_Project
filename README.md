# My Cool Project

A Git learning and collaboration sandbox repository for practicing version control workflows.

## Overview

This repository serves as a practice environment for learning Git operations, branching strategies, and collaborative development workflows. It contains minimal content files used for experimenting with version control.

## Purpose

- Practice Git branching and merging
- Learn pull request workflows
- Experiment with collaborative development
- Understand version control concepts

## Repository Structure

```
My_Cool_Project/
├── README.md       # This file
├── My_code.txt     # Sample content file
└── New_File.txt    # Feature branch example
```

## Git Concepts Demonstrated

- **Branching**: Creating and switching between branches
- **Merging**: Combining branch changes
- **Pull Requests**: Code review workflow
- **Remote Tracking**: Working with origin/main

## How to Use

This is a sandbox for Git practice:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AmirJahan/My_Cool_Project.git

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Explore branches
git branch -a

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b my-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to remote
git push origin my-feature
```

## Learning Exercises

1. Create a feature branch and make changes
2. Practice resolving merge conflicts
3. Submit a pull request
4. Review and merge changes
5. Experiment with rebasing vs merging
